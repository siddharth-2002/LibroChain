#LibroChain
LibroChain is a decentralized knowledge-sharing platform that leverages blockchain technology to provide secure, transparent, and immutable access to educational resources and information. Our goal is to democratize access to learning, ensuring that content is open, censorship-resistant, and accessible to anyone, anywhere.

How It Works
